# Nanodet-plus-3ds
Can't find anything better than a light weight network and light weight framework


## Download

## Build
Read the build guide from [last project](https://github.com/Deepdive543443/Benchncnn-3DS/tree/main) 


## Issues
This demo is using 416x416 weight for 320x320 input because I haven't find 320x320 weights for NCNN available. Also, INT8 performance is not tested
