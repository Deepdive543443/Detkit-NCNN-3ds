## Update 
- Add Fastest Det
- This project has been renamed from Nanodet Plus 3DS to Detkit NCNN 3DS because I'm trying to add more light-weight object detection models into this app.
You can still find older version in [Release](https://github.com/Deepdive543443/Detkit-NCNN-3ds/releases) page.



## Download
Required Homebrew launcher or a title manager like FBI to install or boot.
[3dsx and CIA](https://github.com/Deepdive543443/Nanodet-plus-3ds/releases/tag/1.0.1)

[Pre-build NCNN lib for 3DS](https://github.com/Deepdive543443/Benchncnn-3DS/releases/tag/v0.0.0)

## Build
Read the build guide from [last project](https://github.com/Deepdive543443/Benchncnn-3DS/tree/main) 


## Issues
One core and 64mb RAM are too little for real-time detection
